<ul>
  <li>a priori means “from before the fact” and refers to reasoning done before an event happens.</li>
  <li>a posteriori means “from after the fact” and refers to reasoning done after an event happens.</li>
  <li>ad infinitum means “to infinity’ or “without limit”</li>
  <li>ad hoc means “to this” and refers to reasoning that is quite specific to an event as it is
happening. Such reasoning is usually considered to not generalize to other situations very
well.</li>
  <li>a fortiori means “from the stronger” or “more importantly”.</li>
  <li>∴ (three dots) means “therefore”</li>
  <li>:= (the equal by definition sign) means “is equal by definition to”</li>
  <li>(the such that sign) means “under the condition that”. However, it is much more common
(and less ambiguous) to just abbreviate “such that” as “s.t.”.</li>
